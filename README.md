# HiToDo

HiToDo is a heirarchical todo list manager inspired by [ToDoList](http://www.abstractspoon.com/tdl_resources.html). Eventually, its features will include:

* 26 priority levels
* notes for each task
* [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) backend
* ToDoList XML backend
* assigner and assignee tagging
* time and completion tracking
* time estimation
* due timestamp, start timestamp, assigned timestamp

This being very early in development, none of that works yet :-)

# Requirements

HiToDo requires Python 2.7 and GTK+ 3.2.
